# Hangman - A fun React based game based on 11 different categories and comprising 319 words 🎓

Hangman is the probably the most popular game out there which we have played innumerable times back in our childhood days as well as now. It is a classic game that never gets old.

I am very fond of word quizzes and so I decided to make my own version of this game and topped it with a few creative nuances.

## Categorizations 📋 
There are **11** categories as follows.
` Colors 🎨 `, ` Shapes ⬜️ `, ` Movies 🎥 `, ` Superheroes 🦸 `, ` Countries 🏳️ `, ` Naruto 🌀 `, ` Flowers 🌼 `, ` Disney 🧜‍♀️ `, ` Harry Potter 🧙 `, ` Music 🎸 ` and ` Fantasy 🦄 `.

Each category comprises of 29 words which leads to a total of 319 words. 😎 That's a huge number and I am sure this will be an awesome challenge for anyone who wishes to take it up. 🤠 Furthermore, clues are also provided to make it easier for you to ace this test. 💡

Get Exploring. ✨
